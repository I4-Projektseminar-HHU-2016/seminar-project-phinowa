# Crime in Baltimore

An analysis of the development of security situation in Baltimore, Maryland.
The project is based on a [CSV file](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-safety-2010-2013) from the US government which provides information about the crime rate and several crimes like violence, robbery, domestic violence and gun homicide in all neighborhoods of Baltimore.
The US metropolis with 620.000 inhabitants "suffers the most from poverty, dilapidation, drug addiction and suburbanisation beyond the US American cities" (wikipedia.de) so it's particularly interesting for this survey.

## Features ##

- [x] Python file which was needed to generate the diagrams for the evaluation
- [x] Executable JAR file for the graphical user interface
- [x] The GUI contains an introduction, a detailed analysis based on the diagrams and a conclusion including geographical background research

## Getting Started

The user interface exists as JAR file, so [Java](https://www.java.com/de/download/) should be installed to start the program.
To output the diagrams [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is needed. The diagrams have been created with Seaborn so it has to be installed in cmd with the following command.

```
pip install seaborn
```
